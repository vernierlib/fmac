/**
 *
 *	Bessel function of order one
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * double x, y, j1();
 *
 * y = j1( x );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Returns Bessel function of order one of the argument.
 *
 * The domain is divided into the intervals [0, 8] and
 * (8, infinity). In the first interval a 24 term Chebyshev
 * expansion is used. In the second, the asymptotic
 * trigonometric representation is employed using two
 * rational functions of degree 5/5.
 *
 *
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Absolute error:
 * arithmetic   domain      # trials      peak         rms
 *    DEC       0, 30       10000       4.0e-17     1.1e-17
 *    IEEE      0, 30       30000       2.6e-16     1.1e-16

/**
 *
 *	Bessel function of second kind of order one
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * double x, y, y1();
 *
 * y = y1( x );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Returns Bessel function of the second kind of order one
 * of the argument.
 *
 * The domain is divided into the intervals [0, 8] and
 * (8, infinity). In the first interval a 25 term Chebyshev
 * expansion is used, and a call to j1() is required.
 * In the second, the asymptotic trigonometric representation
 * is employed using two rational functions of degree 5/5.

 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Absolute error:
 * arithmetic   domain      # trials      peak         rms
 *    DEC       0, 30       10000       8.6e-17     1.3e-17
 *    IEEE      0, 30       30000       1.0e-15     1.3e-16

 *	Evaluate polynomial
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * int N;
 * double x, y, coef[N+1], polevl[];
 *
 * y = polevl( x, coef, N );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Evaluates polynomial of degree N:
 *
 *                     2          N
 * y  =  C  + C x + C x  +...+ C x
 *        0    1     2          N
 *
 * Coefficients are stored in reverse order:
 *
 * coef[0] = C  , ..., coef[N] = C  .
 *            N                   0
 *
 *  The function p1evl() assumes that coef[N] = 1.0 and is
 * omitted from the array.  Its calling arguments are
 * otherwise the same as polevl().
 *
 *
 * SPEED:
 *
 * In the interest of speed, there are no checks for out
 * of bounds arithmetic.  This routine is used by most of
 * the functions in the library.  Depending on available
 * equipment features, the user may wish to rewrite the
 * program in microcode or assembly language.
